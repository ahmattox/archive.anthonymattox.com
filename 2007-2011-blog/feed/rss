			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For <a href="http://betascape.org">Betascape</a>, a weekend event of art and technology in Baltimore, I&#8217;m giving a workshop introduction to <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>. For the workshop I&#8217;m going through a series of <a href="http://anthonymattox.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Intro-to-Processing-Workshop.zip">demo scripts</a> that take you through doing basic drawing in Processing through creating simple animations and using objects, arrays, and loops. All the scripts are extensively commented and might help you get started if you&#8217;re interested in learning <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>.</p>
<p>The scripts cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Procedural Drawing</li>
<li>Using Variables</li>
<li>Creating Simple Animations</li>
<li>Using Conditionals</li>
<li>Creating Custom Functions</li>
<li>Animating with Gravity</li>
<li>Mouse Interactions</li>
<li>Repeating Code with Loops</li>
<li>Storing Sequential Data in Arrays</li>
<li>Working with Objects</li>
<li>Arrays of Objects</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> this may be a good place to start. Each script builds off the last and adds a new tool. Go through them slowly and create your own scripts using the new techniques from each. If you get stuck (it gets a little more complex with loops, arrays, and objects) there are tons of other great resources on the <a href="http://processing.org/learning/">Processing Site</a> and if you&#8217;re looking for some specific help, I&#8217;d be happy to point you in the right direction.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I played around a bit with <a href="http://processingjs.org/">processing.js</a>, an awesome bit of software that runs processing scripts in a browser using the HTML canvas element. I wanted to use it to create an animated full browser background for a web page. I couldn&#8217;t find any info on how to do this online, but came up with a solution. It may not be the most elegant, and performance starts taking a big hit at large sizes, but I wanted to share it in case anyone wanted to build on it or already has a better answer. I&#8217;ll also note that I haven&#8217;t tested this thoroughly.</p>
<p>Simply resizing the canvas element just stretches the rendered image so it needs to be changed within processing.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> script is essentially converted into javascript it&#8217;s possible to communicate between the <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> script and other javascripts. So, I added an listener for the window resize event (using <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>), which calls a function in the <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> function to resize the canvas element.</p>
<p>The javascript looks like this:</p>
<pre>
// javascript (requires jQuery http://jquery.com)

var ProcessingInit = function() {
  function resizeWindow() {
    var pCanvas = Processing.getInstanceById('pCanvas');
    pCanvas.resize($(window).width(),$(window).height());
  }
  
  $(window).resize(resizeWindow);
  resizeWindow();
}
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s wrapped in a function so that it can be called from <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> when the application is started. <code>ProcessingInit();</code> in the setup function. This makes sure the canvas element is fully instantiated before it tries to manipulate it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty straightforward on the <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> side as well. That function simply calls the size function again. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good practice, but it seems to work fine.</p>
<pre>
// processing

void setup() {
  size(800,600);
  ProcessingInit();
}

void resize(float X, float  Y) {
  size(X,Y);
}
</pre>

<p><a href="http://games.anthonymattox.com/orbit/">Orbit</a> is an arcade style adventure game. Explore an abandoned field of space junk and collect enough fuel to find your way home. <a href="http://games.anthonymattox.com/orbit/">The game</a> is currently a small segment of the final adventure. In it I focused on developing the basic gameplay and the tone through motion, scale, graphics, and sound. <a href="http://games.anthonymattox.com/orbit/">Put on some headphones and give it a try.</a></p>
<div class="img"><a href="http://anthonymattox.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Orbit-screenshot-1.png" class="lightbox" rel="orbit"><img src="http://anthonymattox.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Orbit-screenshot-1-450x268.png" alt="" title="Orbit-screenshot-1" width="450" height="268" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2954" /></a><small>Screenshots of the game.

<p>In many ways, <a href="http://games.anthonymattox.com/orbit/">Orbit</a> is quite similar to my first game, <a href="http://pulsusgame.com">Pulsus</a>. It&#8217;s just more circles and particles. But, while I&#8217;m certainly still show&#8217;s the same style and interests, I&#8217;ve added a few things to my game design vocabulary here. The biggest thing I tried to add was narrative and character. Although the story and goals are vague, I wanted to bring people into the game more with a bit of setting. I also tried to develop a sense of scale to the world.</p>
<p>Any feedback on the game is very much appreciated. This prototype is likely going to be expanded into an iOS game, with help from the rest of the <a href="http://friendsoftheweb.com">Friends of The Web</a>.</p>

Click to Enlarge.</small></div>
<p>I was recently asked to create some work for a collaborative project. I decided to create some generative work in <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> and try out some ideas I&#8217;ve had in the back of my mind. The script wraps a number of different generative patterns into one system. Each circle has instructions for how it behaves and creates new circles and these instructions change as they grow. The images it creates are more complex and dynamic that a lot of my preview sketches.</p>
<p><strong>A slightly more technical explanation:</strong> The script has an array of objects, I&#8217;ll call them nodes. Each node has a couple of functions for initializing itself, branching new nodes, updating, and rendering. The container creates a new node which grows, branches, and then becomes inactive. The newly branched nodes grow and branch and the cycle continues, growing the image.</p>
<p>The fun part is that the basic &#8216;node&#8217; object can be extended to any number of variations all of which can still be handled as the generic type by the container in the same way. The container tells a node to &#8216;branch&#8217; and it may create new nodes randomly around itself or touching it&#8217;s sides or in a set direction to grow tendrils. Each variation of node also sometimes branches to different types so one structure will morph into another. Other functions, like rendering, can also be extended or overwritten to create different behavior.</p>

<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot of potential in this kind of polymorphic system. I&#8217;ll play around with it some more and maybe post some more technical examples.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last four years at the <a href="http://mica.edu">Maryland Institute College of Art</a> and recently graduated. I had a great experience at <a href="http://mica.edu">MICA</a>. It&#8217;s sad to leave, but I&#8217;m ready to start something new as well.</p>
<p>Moving on I&#8217;m starting my own <a href="http://madebyftw.com">design studio</a>, working on the web and other screen based platforms, with some good friends of mine. We&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks moving and setting up our new studio. We&#8217;re staying here in Baltimore and are excited to join the emerging tech community here. More on that will be coming soon.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll have a little more time for personal work now that school isn&#8217;t taking up every minute of my life. I have a new game in the works (hopefully with a flash prototype coming soon), as well as some updates to <a href="http://pulsusgame.com">Pulsus</a>. I&#8217;d like to blog more consistently, and have a little backlog of things to get that started. Maybe I&#8217;ll even have some time to work on some generative works and some sounds. We&#8217;ll see what keeps my interest.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to be staying in Baltimore and to get back to work after a lot of reshuffling and resettling.</p>
